# Friggin-Lazers
Description: 
  Fun animation of lazers bouncing across the screen
Made this on accident while playing around trying to create a bouncing balls animation.
I played around with it until I made what you see here.

How to Run:
  Refresh the page and relax while watching the soothing lazer beams bounce around the page
  
Future Improvements:
  I would like to add sharks at the origin points of the lazers and have the lazers terminate after a certain number of bounces
